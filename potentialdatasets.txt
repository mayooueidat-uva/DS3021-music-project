so we're gonna try our darndest to avoid kaggle 
- here is a similar project that was conducted at brown university: https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs100/students/project11/
^ i fear the risk of our project being too similar to previous ones, so i wonder if we should change our framing/question - instead of 'what' lyrics exist, perhaps we...
...can consider how popular songs with certain lyrics are. 
or, we can look at social acceptability of certain lyrics or themes. 


some ideas: 
- social acceptability of certain taboo words
- sentiment analysis
