so we're gonna try our darndest to avoid kaggle 
- here is a similar project that was conducted at brown university: https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs100/students/project11/
^ i fear the risk of our project being too similar to previous ones, so i wonder if we should change our framing/question - instead of 'what' lyrics exist, perhaps we...
...can consider how popular songs with certain lyrics are. 
or, we can look at social acceptability of certain lyrics or themes. 


as far as ideas: 
essentially we just 
1) need data, 
2) need to be able to make predictions from it. 
was considering doing something interesting, like predicting the likelihood of encountering the word 'love' or something. 


this is how someone who's done a similar project in the past obtained the lyric data:

the thing is, we don't need just lyric data, we need data with a bunch of 'y-values'. 
scraping the spotify API or the soundcloud API could be useful. we just need some data and some analysis 
shoudln't take as long as we think. 


thoughts on how to fetch data and look at its attributes 
- yoink all the titles and artists from somewhere
- yoink all the data corresponding to the titles and artists from the spotify api
